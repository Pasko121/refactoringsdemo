# refactoringsdemo
This repo contains the code I use in the video at https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/refactoring-made-easy-with-intellicode/ to demo the refactorings feature.

It contains many examples of temperature conversion usage in long form in program.cs, which can be refactored to use the helper functions in the TemperatureConversions class.

Note: The program doesn't perform any useful function besides being a good host for the demo.
